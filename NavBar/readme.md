# ResponsiveAppBar

## Overview

The `ResponsiveAppBar` component is a versatile and responsive navigation bar built with React and Material-UI. It adapts to both mobile and desktop views, displaying a hamburger menu on smaller screens and a full navigation bar on larger screens. The component is highly customizable, allowing you to pass a list of navigation links, a logo, and optional end components such as buttons or other UI elements.
